Would you like me to review that ticket and see if we can find any updates or solutions?\n\nRegarding your question about having multiple user accounts, our current plan doesn't support this feature. However, I can suggest some alternatives for you.\n\nIf you need more than one account for work-related purposes or other reasons, we offer a business plan upgrade that includes multi-user access. You can contact our sales team to discuss the details and pricing.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking to manage multiple accounts separately, we have a recommendation:\n\nWe recommend using a separate email address for each account. For example, if you want to use `john1@example.com` and `john2@example.com`, you can create separate email addresses and use those for your respective accounts.\n\nLet me know which option interests you, or if there's anything else I can help you with.\n\n\n\nIs there anything else I can assist with today?",
